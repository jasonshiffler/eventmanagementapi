This Maven project demonstrates to create a simple REST API using Spring Boot with spring data rest and spring data jpa. A controller is not required, only an Entity class and a CrudRepository Interface are needed. A mySQL backend with is used for the datasource. The create-db file shows how the database table was created and the application properties file shows how to setup the datasource and customize the API path.
